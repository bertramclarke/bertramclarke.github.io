  "QUESTION_7": "Does Super Accelerator give me anonymity online?",
  "ANSWER_7_A": "Super Accelerator is designed to provide you with unfettered access to information online.

Otherwise, Super Accelerator will give you faster access to blocked sites.",
  "QUESTION_8": "What is the difference between Super Accelerator and Super Accelerator Pro?",
  "ANSWER_8_A": "Super Accelerator Pro is built on the same improved Super Accelerator technology, but is faster, more blocking resistant and has unlimited data.",
  "ANSWER_8_B": "Faster: Pro allocates less users per server, thereby giving users improved performance. Furthermore, Pro uses different servers than Free. ",
  "ANSWER_8_C": "Blocking resistant: Super Accelerator Pro is more blocking resistant because Censors can’t identify the servers unless they also have Pro. Also, Super Accelerator Pro employs Smart Servers so if one server is not performing, the user is transferred to another, ensuring steady connection. This allows for improved defense against censor interference with your connection. The Super Accelerator dev team works on a 24 hour schedule to be able to identify blocking techniques by censors and respond quickly to ensure that any users experiencing blocking are online as soon as possible.",
  "ANSWER_8_D": "Unlimited Data: Super Accelerator Pro doesn’t limit data usage, so that those that are reliant on a fast unblocked connection can access all their online content and information whenever they need.",
  "ANSWER_8_E": "To switch from the free version to Super Accelerator Pro, just download Super Accelerator and click on the upgrade button within the interface.",
  "QUESTION_9": "Why do I have to pay for Super Accelerator Pro?",
  "ANSWER_9_A": "The payment feature makes Super Accelerator more blocking resistant because censors cannot infiltrate or block Super Accelerator Pro without paying, which gives you, the user, more stability. We’ve offered Super Accelerator Pro at a competitive price to help us stay around to continue to provide the fastest and most blocking resistant way to get you online.",
  "QUESTION_10": "How much does Super Accelerator Pro cost?",

  "QUESTION_12": "Why does Super Accelerator have a data bandwidth limit?",
  "ANSWER_12_A": "As Super Accelerator users continue to grow, costs of maintaining it increase significantly each month. In order to stick around and keep building and innovating for our users, we need to support our operations by charging a small fee.",
